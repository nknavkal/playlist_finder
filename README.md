# playlist_finder_current

Trying to create a tool that will let a user login and search for a song (or multiple?) and get a list of all their playlists which contain that song. 
- Immediately useful for spotify power users who have many playlists and forget which playlists contain which songs
- eventually would like to use this to help people discover public playlists that have songs they like
